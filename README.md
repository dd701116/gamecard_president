  <strong>Welcome to President. An online card game using TypeScript and React.</strong>
</p>


The object of the game is to become and remain (in subsequent games) the president, that is, the winner of the game by getting rid of all of their cards first in each game. Or on the contrary, the game is not to remain Le Trou-du-cul during the various consecutive games!
